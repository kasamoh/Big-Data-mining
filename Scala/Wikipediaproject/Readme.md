# Determining the most popular programming language  using Wikipedia - Scala #


#### We will get to know Spark by exploring full-text Wikipedia articles  

Gauging how popular a programming language is important for companies judging whether or not they should adopt an emerging programming language. For that reason, industry analyst firm RedMonk has bi-annually computed a ranking of programming language popularity using a variety of data sources, typically from websites like GitHub and StackOverflow. See their top-20 ranking for June 2016 as an example.

In this project , we'll use our full-text data from Wikipedia to produce a rudimentary metric of how popular a programming language is, in an effort to see if our Wikipedia-based rankings bear any relation to the popular Red Monk rankings.

We will complete this exercise on just one node (your laptop), but you can also head over to Databricks Community Edition to experiment with your code on a "micro-cluster" for free.



To start, first download the assignment: wikipedia.zip (http://alaska.epfl.ch/~dockermoocs/bigdata/wikipedia.zip )  For this project , you also need to download the data :

http://alaska.epfl.ch/~dockermoocs/bigdata/wikipedia.dat

and place it in the folder: src/main/resources/wikipedia in your project directory.
