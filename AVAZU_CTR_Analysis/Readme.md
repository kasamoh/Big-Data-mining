Many ads are actually sold on a "pay-per-click" (PPC) basis, meaning the company only pays for ad clicks, not ad views. Thus your optimal approach (as a search engine) is actually to choose an ad based on "expected value", meaning the price of a click times the likelihood that the ad will be clicked. In other words, a \$1.00 ad with a 5% probability of being clicked has an expected value of \$0.05, whereas a \$2.00 ad with a 1% probability of being clicked has an expected value of only \$0.02. In this case, you would choose to display the first ad.

In order for you to maximize expected value, you therefore need to accurately predict the likelihood that a given ad will be clicked, also known as "click-through rate" (CTR).

In this notebook, We will walk through the predictive modeling process of CTR using AVAZU Dataset
